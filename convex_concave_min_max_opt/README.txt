1. Run toy_problem.py to see the max oracle gradient descent converging to different SE based on initial conditions for the Stackleberg game example presented in [1].
2. Run main.py to reproduce the results for the toy gridworld example in the CMS 248 report. Use the boolean flag ADD_EDGE_CUTS_INIT located at the start of main.py to change initial condition.
